Three methods for extracting and reordering search results from a CSV dataset are presented in this repository through a set of Jupyter notebooks. Using cutting-edge methods for information retrieval and natural language processing, the objective is to show users the top 5 pertinent search results.


## Project Structure

The project is structured around three Jupyter notebooks, each implementing a different approach:

1. Semantic Search Results (Semantic_Search.ipynb): This notebook explains how to get relevant search results using semantic search techniques.


2. Combining Semantic Search, BM25, and Re-ranking (BM25(1).ipynb): To improve search results, this method combines BM25, re-ranking techniques, and semantic search.


3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (RAG.ipynb): This notebook use the RAG technique to add generated information to the retrieval process in order to improve the relevancy of search results.



## Installation

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.7 or later).

1. Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/shemanth1504/Homework3


2. Install Dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


The requirements.txt file should include a list of all the Python libraries your notebooks utilize, such as torch, transformers, numpy, pandas, and any other libraries specifically needed for BM25 implementation or semantic search.



3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook


Open the notebook you want to use, then navigate there and follow the directions.


## Usage

With commands and step-by-step instructions on how to use the implemented approach to obtain and rank search results from a CSV dataset, each notebook is meant to be self-contained. 


- Make sure your CSV dataset is compatible with the notebooks and has the proper formatting.
- To enter your search query and get the results, adhere to the guidelines provided in each notebook.
